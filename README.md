# License_Plate_Number_Recognition

License plate recognition is an important and popular research issue in image processing and computer vision. Applications based on license plate detection are playing an increasingly important role in our daily life, such as unattended parking lots, security control of restricted areas, congestion pricing, and automatic toll collection. License plate detection is the basis of license plate recognition. Although the research of license plate detection started relatively early, the detection systems today are still not perfect; a number of factors such as motion blur, occlusion, and lighting changes can lead to large visual variations in plate appearance, which can severely degrade the performance of the license plate detector.
